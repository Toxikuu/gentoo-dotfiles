# Gentoo Dotfiles
My dotfiles for gentoo.

## Note
Since these are my personal dots, they aren't made with compatibility in mind. If you decide to use them, you'll have to change a lot of instances of my username (tox) with yours and adjust filepaths. I recommend reading through the config files and tweaking them as necessary.

## Installation
Backup your existing dotfiles, clone this repo, and move the contents to ~/.config/
